# Team Digest (2025-10-13 - 2025-10-19)

_Range: 2025-10-13 → 2025-10-19 | Source: logs | Days matched: 5 | Actions: 0_

## Summary
Kickoff for Q4 priorities.

Team tested initial daily digest run.

Daily digest normalized to single date.

Confirmed Slack posting works.

Weekly digest still missing multiple days; investigating.

## Decisions
\- Adopt automated digest workflows (owner: Anuraj Deol).

\- Standardize note format across team.

\- Keep `/logs` structure as default.

\- Weekly digest should cover Monâ€“Sun.

\- Weekly digest must aggregate multiple files, not just one.

\- Proceed with customer-ready quick start once digests stable.

\- Switch weekly digest to last full calendar week.

## Actions
_No actions._

## Risks
\- Onboarding delay if checklist not ready by Friday.

\- Slack webhook misconfiguration could block delivery.

\- Possible confusion if digest dates donâ€™t match calendar week.

\- Customers may be confused if no sample logs are included.

\- Risk of shipping with incorrect weekly logic.

## Dependencies
\- Roadmap slides depend on product input from design team.

\- Digest run depends on GitHub Actions green workflows.

\- Weekly digest requires logs spanning Monâ€“Sun for testing.

\- Monthly digest depends on a full set of daily logs.

\- Weekly digest requires valid date math in workflow.

## Notes
\- Everyone aligned on testing with sample logs this week.

\- Digest showed duplicate dates â€” fix applied in daily workflow.

\- Workflow buttons restored after YAML fixes.

\- Repo artifacts show correct dates for daily/monthly.

\- Daily digest passed with single date normalization.
