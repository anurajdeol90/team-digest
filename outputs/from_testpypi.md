## Summary
Kickoff for Q4 priorities.

Team tested initial daily digest run.

Daily digest normalized to single date.

Confirmed Slack posting works.

Weekly digest still missing multiple days; investigating.

## Decisions
- Adopt automated digest workflows (owner: Anuraj Deol).

- Standardize note format across team.

- Keep `/logs` structure as default.

- Weekly digest should cover Mon–Sun.

- Weekly digest must aggregate multiple files, not just one.

- Proceed with customer-ready quick start once digests stable.

- Switch weekly digest to last full calendar week.

## Actions
### High priority
- Alex to configure Slack channel integration.
- Anuraj Deol to finalize config vs file-based input plan.
- Anuraj Deol to verify weekly digest date window.
- Priya to review artifact output for accuracy.
- Sam to patch weekly-digest.yml date window.

### Medium priority
- Alex to add new meeting notes examples.
- Alex to update documentation index.md.
- Anuraj Deol to retest with multiple logs in place.
- Priya to prepare Q4 roadmap slides.
- Sam to draft monthly digest example.

### Low priority
- Alex to capture screenshots of passing workflows.
- Anuraj Deol to document onboarding checklist.
- Priya to check Slack formatting preview.
- Priya to clean up repo for publishing.
- Sam to explore customer documentation tools.

## Risks
- Onboarding delay if checklist not ready by Friday.

- Slack webhook misconfiguration could block delivery.

- Possible confusion if digest dates don’t match calendar week.

- Customers may be confused if no sample logs are included.

- Risk of shipping with incorrect weekly logic.

## Dependencies
- Roadmap slides depend on product input from design team.

- Digest run depends on GitHub Actions green workflows.

- Weekly digest requires logs spanning Mon–Sun for testing.

- Monthly digest depends on a full set of daily logs.

- Weekly digest requires valid date math in workflow.

## Notes
- Everyone aligned on testing with sample logs this week.

- Digest showed duplicate dates — fix applied in daily workflow.

- Workflow buttons restored after YAML fixes.

- Repo artifacts show correct dates for daily/monthly.

- Daily digest passed with single date normalization.
